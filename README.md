# Next Word Prediction
I need to implement next word prediction algorithm within 48 hours for one challenge. That is done in the 2018. Firstly I tried with RNN but that did not work out as did not have enough time to gather more data, analyze what is going on etc. So I decided to continue with n-grams and tried different version of them. That is pretty basic approach but aim was having a working model just within 2 days so I think that is enough to show that we can achieve basic model which works pretty OK just within few days. 

I am sharing that after few years just to keep historic record.
